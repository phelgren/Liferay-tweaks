# Personal User Bar - Liferay 7
This started as a "problem" that I posted to get some answers but it is now a working example of the "User personal bar" replacement using Freemarker as the template rather than a JSP.

The code is fully functional and is presented here for folks who want to use FTL rather than JSP in their portlets.
